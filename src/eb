/*error boundary we are facing multiple errors in  react .to handle thos errors and display fallback ui

fallback ui - when we get the error, we diaply the msg like 500 internal error , page not found , oops somethig went wromg

try catch - imperative coding


it is a custom component not react inbuilt
<errorboundary>
</errorboundary>

erroroundaries do not catch errors for evnt handlers , async code, server side rendering , 

error boundary - declarative coding
