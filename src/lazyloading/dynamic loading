it is used to increase the performance

in routing, const Home = React.lazy(()=>import(''))

when we perform lazy loading in routing, 
then it will not shown error bt when it comes to compoents wrap the component in <suspense fallback={<div>loading..</div>}></suspense> 

webpack , home-login-regidter(chunk.js)

lazy loading - separate chunk.js

does not unnecessary loading.......
